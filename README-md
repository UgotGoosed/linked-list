# Project Title

Write a program to animate search, insertion, and deletion in a linked list. The search button will search
a specified value in the list. The delete button will delete a specified value from the list.
The insert button appends the value into the list if the index is not specified; otherwise, it inserts
the value into the specified index in the list

## Analysis Steps

I needed to create a Jpanel to hold a Textfield to get values for a value and an index. 
I needed to create buttons to search, insert and delete values and indexes.
if a value is added without an index, it will be added to the back end of the list.

### Design

I used 2 classes. One for the Jpanel set up and the action handlers.
Another for the Linked List Animation where the list would have head and tail null 
if no numbers were in list.
once a value was put in, the head and tail labels would then point to the same number.
if another number was inserted, it would be added to the end where the tail would
then be pointing to the number.


### Testing

Once the panel was set up, setting up the size of the boxes and placement of the head and tail 
labels and boxes were just playing with numbers. First I did 10 but the head and tail were 
directly on top of each other and the boxes for the numbers were way to small. So I increased the
size to 30 and it seemed to work nicely.

drawing the arrows worked, it was just playing with numbers until they looked nice.

testing the buttons worked when i entered values and clicked. no problems there.
